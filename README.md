# motion-planning

This crate implements motion planning primitives in Rust.

## Maintenance Status

This project is still experimental.  We have not released v1 yet, so it does
not have a stable public API.  We have also not started releasing tagged
versions yet, either, so the code should be considered in an "in-development"
stage.

## Releases

This project adheres to semantic versioning.  Once a major release occurs, any
subsequent releases that change the existing public API will result in another
major release.  New arguments to binaries, new features, or additional features
will warrant new minor releases.  Any fixes to existing behavior or
non-API-related changes will warrant new patch releases.
