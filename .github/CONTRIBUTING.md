# Contributing

Your contributions are welcome.

Please fork to your own account, make commits, rebase onto `master`, then open
a pull request against `master`.

## Guidelines

Contributions will be accepted based on a number of criteria, including but not
necessarily limited to:

- usefulness for inclusion in the base project,
- criticality,
- style consistency,
- test coverage, and
- contributor responsiveness.

In particular,

- **Every pull request must be 100% covered** for acceptance.  This is measured
  by automated tools and submitted back as feedback on pull requests.  Every
  line of code in the project must be executed _at least_ once in the test
  suite.

- **Every pull request must be formatted by `cargo fmt`, a.k.a. `rustfmt`**, in
  accordance with the guidelines codified in the `rustfmt.toml` file.
